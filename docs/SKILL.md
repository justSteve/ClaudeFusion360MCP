## Section 0: Session Initialization Protocol (CRITICAL)

### 0.1 Vision-First Verification

**MANDATORY ON EVERY SESSION START:**

Before executing ANY Fusion 360 MCP commands, Claude MUST:

1. **Use Vision** to visually inspect the current Fusion 360 state
2. **Verify design continuity** - the drawing may not have saved where you left off
3. **Check what actually exists** before assuming prior work is intact

```
PROTOCOL:
1. Call State-Tool with use_vision=true
2. Visually analyze:
   - Is the expected design file open?
   - What bodies/features are visible?
   - Does the timeline show expected operations?
   - Are there any error indicators?
3. Call get_design_info() to confirm programmatically
4. Compare visual vs programmatic state
5. Only then proceed with operations
```

### 0.2 Why This Matters

**Common State Mismatches:**
- Fusion 360 may have crashed and recovered to earlier state
- User may have undone operations after Claude's session ended
- Auto-save may not have captured all changes
- Design may have been edited manually between sessions

**The Cost of Skipping:**
- Operations on non-existent bodies ? errors
- Wrong body indices ? corrupted geometry
- Wasted time debugging phantom issues

### 0.3 Session Start Checklist

```
? Vision check completed
? Design file name matches expected
? Body count matches expected
? Key features visually confirmed
? Timeline length reasonable for work done
? No error dialogs or warnings visible
? get_design_info() matches visual observation
```

**Only proceed with CAD operations after ALL checks pass.**


## Section 1: Coordinate System Mastery

### 1.1 The Global Coordinate System (MEMORIZE THIS)

Fusion 360 MCP uses a right-handed coordinate system. From the **FRONT VIEW** (looking at the origin from positive Y):

```
                    +Z (Vertical/Up)
                     |
                     |
                     |
                     +------------ +X (Horizontal/Right)
                    /
                   /
                  /
                +Y (Depth/Toward Viewer)
```

| Axis | Physical Meaning | Positive Direction | Sketch Plane Usage |
|------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **X** | Width | Right | Horizontal in XY and XZ |
| **Y** | Depth | Toward viewer | Vertical in YZ, Horizontal in XY |
| **Z** | Height | Up | Vertical in XZ and YZ |

### 1.2 Construction Plane Deep Dive

Understanding plane selection is CRITICAL for correct geometry:

#### XY Plane (Horizontal/Ground Plane)
```
        +Y (depth)
         |
         |
         +-------- +X (width)
        
Extrusion: +Z (up) or -Z (down)
```
**Use For**: Floor plans, base plates, horizontal surfaces, table tops, PCB layouts.

#### XZ Plane (Vertical/Front Wall)
```
        +Z (height)
         |
         |
         +-------- +X (width)
        
Extrusion: +Y (toward you) or -Y (away)
```
**Use For**: Vertical panels, wall-mounted items, facades, elevation views.

#### YZ Plane (Vertical/Side Wall)
```
        +Z (height)
         |
         |
         +-------- +Y (depth)
        
Extrusion: +X (right) or -X (left)
```
**Use For**: Side profiles, cross-sections, lateral features.

### 1.3 Sketch-to-World Coordinate Mapping (EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED)

**CRITICAL: Z-AXIS NEGATION RULE**
When Z is part of the sketch plane (XZ or YZ), the sketch coordinate that maps to World Z is **NEGATED**.

| Sketch On | Sketch X -> World | Sketch Y -> World | Extrusion -> World | Z Negated? |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------| -----------|
| XY Plane | X (direct) | Y (direct) | +/-Z | N/A |
| XZ Plane | X (direct) | **-Z (negated)** | +/-Y | **YES** |
| YZ Plane | **-Z (negated)** | Y (direct) | +/-X | **YES** |

**Practical Application:**
- XY plane: x1,x2 -> World X; y1,y2 -> World Y (direct mapping)
- XZ plane: x1,x2 -> World X; y1,y2 -> -World Z (to get Z from A to B, use y1=-B, y2=-A)
- YZ plane: x1,x2 -> -World Z (to get Z from A to B, use x1=-B, x2=-A); y1,y2 -> World Y

## Section 1.4: MCP Tool Limitations (CRITICAL)

### 1.4.1 Missing Boolean Operations

The Fusion 360 MCP currently **DOES NOT SUPPORT** boolean operations:
- **No Cut operation**: Cannot subtract one body from another
- **No Join operation**: Cannot merge bodies together  
- **No Intersect operation**: Cannot create intersection of bodies

**Impact**: The `extrude()` function ALWAYS creates a NEW BODY. It cannot:
- Cut holes in existing bodies
- Add material to existing bodies
- Perform any combine operations

**Workaround**: User must manually perform Modify > Combine in Fusion 360 UI after Claude creates the tool body.

### 1.4.2 Workflow for Creating Cutouts

Since boolean cut is not available, use this workflow:

1. **Create the main body** (e.g., phone case shell)
2. **Create tool bodies** for each cutout (camera hole, button slots, port openings)
3. **Inform user** which bodies need to be combined/cut
4. **User performs** Modify > Combine manually:
   - Target Body: Main body
   - Tool Bodies: Cutout bodies
   - Operation: Cut
   - Keep Tools: No (usually)

### 1.4.3 Requested MCP Enhancements

The following functions are needed but not yet implemented:

| Function | Purpose | Parameters Needed |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `combine()` | Boolean operations | target_body, tool_body, operation (cut/join/intersect), keep_tools |
| `extrude_cut()` | Extrude and subtract | Same as extrude, plus target_body |
| `extrude_join()` | Extrude and add | Same as extrude, plus target_body |

See: `MCP_ENHANCEMENT_REQUEST_Fusion360.md` for full specification.

### 1.4.4 Face/Edge Index Instability

**CRITICAL**: Face and edge indices are NOT stable across operations.

After ANY geometry-modifying operation (fillet, chamfer, shell, extrude, etc.):
- Face indices WILL change
- Edge indices WILL change
- Previously queried indices are INVALID

**Required Protocol**:
1. Perform geometry operation
2. **IMMEDIATELY** call `get_body_info()` to get NEW indices
3. Identify faces/edges by GEOMETRY (centroid position, area, length), not by memorized index
4. Use fresh indices for next operation

**Example - Finding Top Face After Modifications**:
```
1. Call get_body_info(body_index=0)
2. Look at faces array
3. Find face where centroid.z == bounding_box.max.z
4. Use THAT face index for shell or other operations
```

### 1.4 Origin Behavior and Offset Planes (NEW in v7.0)

**Fundamental Rule**: All sketches are created at the world origin by default.

**NEW: Offset Planes**: MCP v7.0 supports creating sketches on offset planes:

```python
# Sketch 5cm above origin
create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=5)
draw_rectangle(x1=-5, y1=-5, x2=5, y2=5)
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=2)  # Creates geometry from Z=5 to Z=7
```

This eliminates the need for complex sketch positioning workarounds!


### 1.5 Utility Operations (v8.2)

The MCP now includes utility operations for cleanup and iteration:

#### undo(count=1)
Undo recent operations in Fusion 360.

```python
undo()           # Undo last operation
undo(count=5)    # Undo last 5 operations
undo(count=20)   # Undo up to 20 operations
```

**Returns:** `{"undone_count": 5, "requested_count": 5}`

**Use Cases:**
- Revert failed operations
- Clean up after experimentation
- Reset to known good state

#### delete_body(body_index=None)
Delete a specific body by index.

```python
delete_body()              # Delete most recent body
delete_body(body_index=3)  # Delete body at index 3
```

**Returns:** `{"deleted_body": "Body5", "deleted_index": 3, "remaining_bodies": 4}`

**Important:** After deleting a body, remaining body indices shift down!

#### delete_sketch(sketch_index=None)
Delete a specific sketch by index.

```python
delete_sketch()                # Delete most recent sketch
delete_sketch(sketch_index=2)  # Delete sketch at index 2
```

**Returns:** `{"deleted_sketch": "Sketch3", "deleted_index": 2, "remaining_sketches": 4}`

#### Cleanup Workflow Example

```python
# Created 5 tool bodies but design is wrong
get_design_info()  # Shows body_count: 6

# Delete unwanted bodies (work backwards to avoid index shifting)
delete_body(body_index=5)
delete_body(body_index=4)
delete_body(body_index=3)
delete_body(body_index=2)
delete_body(body_index=1)

# Or just undo all the extrusions
undo(count=5)
```


---


### 1.6 Join Protocol (CRITICAL - USER REQUESTED)

**RULE: Joining should be the FINAL step. Always verify with user before combining bodies.**

**Why This Matters:**
- Once joined, individual parts cannot be easily edited
- Errors caught before joining are easy to fix
- Errors caught after joining require undo/rebuild

**Protocol:**
1. Create all parts as separate bodies
2. Position and verify each part visually
3. **ASK USER** to confirm before any join/combine operation
4. Only after user approval: execute combine(operation="join")

**Example Workflow:**
```python
# Create blade, crossguard, grip, pommel as separate bodies
# ... modeling operations ...

get_design_info()  # Show body count
# "You should now have 4 bodies: blade, crossguard, grip, pommel"
# "Please verify alignment. Ready to join?"

# WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION

# Only then:
combine(operation="join", target_body=0, tool_bodies=[1,2,3])
```

**Never auto-join** - always pause for user verification first.


## Section 2: Complete Tool Reference

### 2.1 Sketch Creation and Management

#### `create_sketch(plane, offset=0)` âœ¨ ENHANCED
Initiates a new sketch on the specified construction plane.

**Parameters**:
| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `plane` | string | Yes | - | "XY", "XZ", or "YZ" |
| `offset` | number | No | 0 | Offset distance from origin (cm) |

**NEW: Offset Capability**:
```python
# Create sketch at different heights
create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=0)    # At Z=0
create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=5)    # At Z=5
create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=-3)   # At Z=-3

# Stacking without overlap
create_sketch(plane="XY")
draw_rectangle(x1=-5, y1=-5, x2=5, y2=5)
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=2)  # Z: 0â†’2
create_component(name="Base")

create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=2)  # Start where base ends!
draw_rectangle(x1=-4, y1=-4, x2=4, y2=4)
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=3)  # Z: 2â†’5
create_component(name="Top")
```

#### `finish_sketch()`
Exits sketch edit mode. Required before any 3D operations.

### 2.2 Sketch Geometry Tools

#### `draw_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
Creates a rectangle using two corner points (all values in cm).

**Centering Strategies**:
```python
# Centered at origin (RECOMMENDED)
width, height = 20, 10
draw_rectangle(x1=-width/2, y1=-height/2, x2=width/2, y2=height/2)

# Corner at origin
draw_rectangle(x1=0, y1=0, x2=width, y2=height)
```

#### `draw_circle(center_x, center_y, radius)`
Creates a circle (all values in cm).

#### `draw_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
Creates a straight line segment. Lines must form CLOSED loops for extrusion.

#### `draw_arc(center_x, center_y, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)`
Creates a circular arc. Start and end must be equidistant from center.


##### Arc Direction Control (CRITICAL)

The `draw_arc` function draws from start to end around the center point. **The direction of travel determines which way the arc curves.**

**Arc Direction Rule:**
- Arc travels **counterclockwise** from start to end (when viewed from +Z)
- Swapping start and end points **reverses the curvature direction**

**Example - Stadium/Obround Shape (for ergonomic handles):**

```python
# WRONG - arcs curve INWARD (concave):
draw_arc(start_x=-0.7, start_y=0.2, end_x=-0.7, end_y=-0.8, center_x=-0.7, center_y=-0.3)

# CORRECT - arcs curve OUTWARD (convex):
draw_arc(start_x=-0.7, start_y=-0.8, end_x=-0.7, end_y=0.2, center_x=-0.7, center_y=-0.3)
```

**Visual Guide:**
```
For a stadium shape (pill/obround):
    
    ___________
   (           )   <- Arc curves OUTWARD (correct)
   |           |
   |           |
   (___________) 

If arcs are inverted:
    ___________
   )           (   <- Arc curves INWARD (wrong!)
   |           |
```

**Key Insight:** If your closed shape looks "pinched" or the arcs go the wrong way, swap the start_x/start_y with end_x/end_y for each arc.

#### `draw_polygon(center_x, center_y, radius, sides=6)`

### 2.5 Component and Assembly Tools

#### `create_component(name=None)`
Converts the most recent body into a named component.

#### `list_components()`
Returns all components with positions and bounding boxes.

#### `delete_component(name=None, index=None)`
Removes a component by name or index.

#### `check_interference()`
Detects bounding box collisions. **MANDATORY** after every component creation.

### 2.6 NEW: Component Positioning â­ CRITICAL

#### `move_component(x=0, y=0, z=0, index=None, name=None, absolute=True)` â­ NEW
Moves a component to a new position.

**Parameters**:
| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `x, y, z` | number | No | 0 | Target position or offset (cm) |
| `index` | integer | No | None | Component index |

# Move by name
move_component(x=0, y=0, z=10, name="Top_Cover")
```

**Why This Matters**:
Previously, all geometry started at origin causing overlaps. Now you can:
1. Create geometry centered at origin (easiest to design)
2. Convert to component
3. Move to final position

```python
# NEW ASSEMBLY WORKFLOW
# Step 1: Create base at origin
create_sketch(plane="XY")
draw_rectangle(x1=-10, y1=-10, x2=10, y2=10)
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=2)
create_component(name="Base")

# Step 2: Create top at origin (easier to design centered)
create_sketch(plane="XY")
draw_rectangle(x1=-8, y1=-8, x2=8, y2=8)
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=3)
create_component(name="Top")

# Step 3: Move top to proper position
move_component(z=2, name="Top")  # Now sits on top of base!

# Step 4: Verify
list_components()
check_interference()
```

#### `rotate_component(angle, axis="Z", index=None, name=None, origin_x=0, origin_y=0, origin_z=0)` â­ NEW

Animates a revolute joint.

#### `set_joint_distance(distance, joint_index=None)`
Animates a slider joint.

### 2.8 NEW: Inspection and Measurement

#### `get_body_info(body_index=None)` â­ NEW
Returns detailed information about edges and faces.

**Parameters**:
| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `body_index` | integer | No | Last | Which body to inspect |

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "body_name": "Body1",

## Section 3: Assembly Positioning Mastery

### 3.1 The New Workflow (v7.0)

With `move_component`, assembly positioning is dramatically simplified:

**OLD Workflow (v6.0 and earlier)**:
```python
# Had to offset geometry in the sketch itself
create_sketch(plane="XY")
draw_rectangle(x1=15, y1=-5, x2=25, y2=5)  # Offset in sketch
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=2)
create_component(name="Part2")
```

**NEW Workflow (v7.0)**:
```python
# Create centered at origin (easier to design)
create_sketch(plane="XY")
draw_rectangle(x1=-5, y1=-5, x2=5, y2=5)
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=2)
create_component(name="Part2")

# Move to final position
move_component(x=20, y=0, z=0, name="Part2")
```

### 3.2 Complete Assembly Example

**Task**: Create a box with lid

```python
# STEP 1: Create box body
batch([
    {"name": "create_sketch", "params": {"plane": "XY"}},
    {"name": "draw_rectangle", "params": {"x1": -5, "y1": -5, "x2": 5, "y2": 5}},
    {"name": "finish_sketch", "params": {}},
    {"name": "extrude", "params": {"distance": 4}}
])

# Shell to make it hollow (open top)
get_body_info()  # Find top face
shell(thickness=0.2, faces_to_remove=[0])
create_component(name="Box_Body")

# STEP 2: Create lid (at origin for easy design)
batch([
    {"name": "create_sketch", "params": {"plane": "XY"}},
    {"name": "draw_rectangle", "params": {"x1": -5.2, "y1": -5.2, "x2": 5.2, "y2": 5.2}},
    {"name": "finish_sketch", "params": {}},
    {"name": "extrude", "params": {"distance": 0.5}}
])
create_component(name="Lid")

# STEP 3: Position lid on top of box
move_component(z=4, name="Lid")

# STEP 4: Add hinge joint
create_revolute_joint(
    component1_index=0,
    component2_index=1,
    x=-5.2, y=0, z=4,
    axis_x=0, axis_y=1, axis_z=0,
    min_angle=0, max_angle=120
)

# STEP 5: Verify
list_components()
check_interference()
fit_view()

# Test the hinge
set_joint_angle(45)
```

### 3.3 Assembly Verification Protocol

**MANDATORY after every component creation**:

```python
# Step 1: Check positions
list_components()

# Step 2: Check interference
check_interference()

# Step 3: Verify dimensions
measure(type="body")

# Step 4: Visual check
fit_view()
```

*End of Fusion 360 MCP Skill Guide for Claude Opus v4.5*



## Section 6: VERIFIED Lessons Learned (CPI Integration)

The following hard constraints have been VERIFIED through documented failures and successful resolution. These are NOT suggestions - they are MANDATORY protocols.

---

### 6.1 Unit Confusion (CPI_Fusion360_UnitConfusion)

**STATUS: VERIFIED** ?

**The Golden Rule: ALL Fusion 360 MCP dimensions are in CENTIMETERS.**

| Real World | MCP Value | Example |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 1mm | 0.1 | M3 screw = 0.3cm |
| 5mm | 0.5 | Small gap |
| 10mm | 1.0 | 1cm (easy) |
| 25mm | 2.5 | ~1 inch |
| 50mm | 5.0 | |
| 100mm | 10.0 | |

**Common Component Sizes (in cm for MCP):**

| Component | Real Size | MCP Values |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 | 85x56mm | 8.5 x 5.6 |
| Pi Zero | 65x30mm | 6.5 x 3.0 |
| 18650 Battery | 65x18mm | 6.5 x 1.8 |

**RED FLAGS - STOP AND VERIFY:**
- Value > 50: Are you sure? That is 50cm = ~20 inches
- Value > 100: Very likely mm/cm confusion
- Value > 200: Almost certainly wrong

**Quick Mental Math:**
- mm to cm: Move decimal LEFT one place (165mm ? 16.5cm)
- cm to mm: Move decimal RIGHT one place (8.5cm ? 85mm)

---

### 6.2 Extrusion Direction (CPI_Fusion360_ExtrusionDirection)

**STATUS: VERIFIED** ?

**Pre-Extrusion Checklist (MANDATORY):**
1. Identify target: Where should material END UP?
2. Identify sketch plane: Where is the sketch located?
3. Calculate direction: Does positive or negative get me there?
4. Verify operation: This creates a NEW BODY (no join/cut in MCP)

**Plane to Extrusion Direction Mapping:**

| Sketch Plane | +Distance Goes | -Distance Goes |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| XY (offset=0) | +Z (up) | -Z (down) |
| XY (offset=5) | +Z (up from offset) | -Z (toward origin) |
| XZ | +Y (toward viewer) | -Y (away) |
| YZ | +X (right) | -X (left) |

**Common Scenario - Creating a Lid on Top of a Case:**
```python
# Case top surface at Z = 3cm, want 0.5cm thick lid
create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=3)  # Sketch at top of case
draw_rectangle(...)                   # Lid outline
finish_sketch()
extrude(distance=0.5)                # +Z = up, AWAY from case = CORRECT
# extrude(distance=-0.5)             # -Z = down, INTO case = WRONG (would cut)
```

---

### 6.3 Component Positioning (CPI_Fusion360_ComponentPositioning)

**STATUS: VERIFIED** ?

**Stacking Mental Model:**

"Stacking" means components OVERLAP in XY view (same X,Y, different Z):
```
Top View (looking down Z axis):
+-------------------+
| All components    |  Overlapping in XY
| at same X,Y       |
| different Z       |
+-------------------+
```

"Spreading" means components are ADJACENT (different X,Y, same Z):
```
Top View:
+-------+ +-------+ +-------+
| Comp1 | | Comp2 | | Comp3 |  Different X,Y positions
+-------+ +-------+ +-------+
```

**Pre-Positioning Checklist (MANDATORY):**
1. Query First: `list_components()` to get positions and sizes
2. Clarify Layout: Ask user "Stacked along which axis?" if unclear
3. Plan Offsets: Calculate Z offsets based on component heights
4. Verify After: Check new positions match intent

**Stack Height Calculation:**
```python
# For vertical stack:
# Component 1: Z = 0
# Component 2: Z = Height of Comp1 + gap
# Component 3: Z = Height of (Comp1 + Comp2) + gap
move_component(name="Display", x=0, y=0, z=0)
move_component(name="Pi", x=0, y=0, z=display_height + 0.1)
move_component(name="Battery", x=0, y=0, z=display_height + pi_height + 0.2)
```

### 6.4 Blade Bevels with Chamfer (CPI_Fusion360_BladeBevels)

**STATUS: VERIFIED** ?

**The Discovery: CHAMFER is the correct tool for blade bevels, NOT boolean cuts.**

**Why Chamfer Works:**
- Direct edge selection - no positioning required
- Built-in to MCP as `chamfer(edges=[], distance=X)`
- Clean, predictable results

**Why Boolean Cuts Failed:**
- MCP lacks native combine() with cut operation
- Positioning cutting bodies precisely is error-prone
- Coordinate confusion led to multiple failed attempts

**Chamfer Distance Formula:**
```
Sharp edge meeting at centerline: chamfer_distance = blade_thickness / 2
Partial bevel (leaves flat spine): chamfer_distance < blade_thickness / 2
```

**Edge Identification Protocol (for models with 50+ edges):**
```python
# Step 1: Get basic body info (shows first 50 edges)
get_body_info(body_index=0)

# Step 2: Search for long edges by measurement
batch([
    {"name": "measure", "params": {"type": "edge", "body_index": 0, "edge_index": 100}},
    {"name": "measure", "params": {"type": "edge", "body_index": 0, "edge_index": 150}},
    {"name": "measure", "params": {"type": "edge", "body_index": 0, "edge_index": 175}},
])

# Step 3: Identify blade edges by length
# Blade edges: ~85cm (main blade length)
# Grip edges: ~75cm (handle length)
```

**HARD CONSTRAINTS:**
- Always use `get_body_info()` first to understand edge structure
- Use `measure()` to find edges beyond the 50-edge display limit
- Verify chamfer distance is appropriate for blade thickness
- Chamfer BOTH sides for symmetric blade

---

### 6.5 CPI Cross-Reference Index

| CPI Document | Key Lesson | Hard Constraint |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| UnitConfusion | ALL values in cm | Divide mm by 10 before API call |
| ExtrusionDirection | Know where material goes | Check plane?direction mapping |
| ComponentPositioning | Stack vs Spread | Query positions BEFORE moving |
| BladeBevels | Use chamfer for edges | Never use boolean cuts for bevels |

## Save vs Export (Critical Distinction)

| Action | What It Does | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Save** | Persists .f3d design to Fusion cloud | Design preserved in Fusion |
| **Export** | Creates copy in external format | STL/STEP file on disk |

**⚠️ Export does NOT save the design.** These are separate operations.

The current MCP does not have a `save_design` command. If a user asks to "save", you must:
1. Inform them: "The MCP cannot save directly to Fusion 360's cloud storage"
2. Request they manually save via **File → Save** or **Ctrl+S**
3. Wait for confirmation before proceeding
4. Then export if also requested
