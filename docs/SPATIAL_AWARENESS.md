# Spatial Awareness & Geometric Verification Skill v1.2

> **Empirically Verified**: Every finding in this document was discovered through actual CAD
> failures, not theoretical analysis. The Z-negation rule (Section 1.2) required three
> failed attempts before the correct pattern was identified. The face index instability rule
> (Section 4.4) was discovered when a shell operation destroyed a model by targeting the
> wrong face. The XZ plane inversion was confirmed against Autodesk engineering documentation
> (Jeff Strater, Engineering Director). **This knowledge transfers regardless of which MCP
> implementation runs underneath.**

## Preamble: Why This Skill Exists

This skill addresses a critical gap in AI-assisted CAD: **spatial reasoning verification**.
The Fusion 360 MCP skill teaches tool syntax; this skill teaches how to VERIFY that geometry
will land where intended BEFORE executing operations.

**Core Principle**: Never assume spatial relationships — verify them programmatically.

**Load this skill WITH the Fusion360 skill for any CAD work.**

## Section 1: Coordinate System Quick Reference

### 1.1 Axis Definitions (Fusion 360 MCP)

```
                    +Z (Up/Height)
                     |
                     |
                     |_______ +X (Right/Width)
                    /
                   /
                  +Y (Toward Viewer/Depth)
```

| Axis | Positive Direction | Common Usage |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| X | Right | Width dimension |
| Y | Toward viewer | Depth dimension |
| Z | Up | Height dimension |

### 1.2 Plane-to-World Coordinate Mapping (EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED)

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Z-AXIS NEGATION RULE** ⚠️

When Z is part of the sketch plane (XZ or YZ), the sketch coordinate that maps to World Z is **NEGATED**.

| Plane | Sketch X → | Sketch Y → | Extrude + → | Extrude - → | Z Negated? |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **XY** | World X | World Y | +Z (up) | -Z (down) | N/A |
| **XZ** | World X | **World -Z** | +Y (toward) | -Y (away) | **YES** |
| **YZ** | **World -Z** | World Y | +X (right) | -X (left) | **YES** |

### 1.3 Practical Coordinate Calculation

**For XY Plane (no negation):**
```
Want World X from A to B → Sketch x1=A, x2=B
Want World Y from A to B → Sketch y1=A, y2=B
```

**For XZ Plane (Y maps to -Z):**
```
Want World X from A to B → Sketch x1=A, x2=B
Want World Z from A to B → Sketch y1=-B, y2=-A  ← NEGATE AND SWAP
```

**For YZ Plane (X maps to -Z):**
```
Want World Z from A to B → Sketch x1=-B, x2=-A  ← NEGATE AND SWAP
Want World Y from A to B → Sketch y1=A, y2=B
```

### 1.4 Examples

**Example 1: Bump centered at Z=1 on XZ plane**
- Want World Z: 0.5 to 1.5
- Sketch Y = -World Z
- Sketch y1 = -1.5, y2 = -0.5

**Example 2: Bump centered at Z=1 on YZ plane**
- Want World Z: 0.5 to 1.5
- Sketch X = -World Z
- Sketch x1 = -1.5, x2 = -0.5

**Example 3: Bump on XY plane at Z=5**
- Use offset=5 to place sketch at Z=5
- Sketch X and Y map directly (no negation)
- Extrude +distance goes up (+Z), -distance goes down (-Z)

### 1.5 Offset Plane Interpretation

When using `create_sketch(plane, offset)`:

| Plane | offset=5 places sketch at | offset=-3 places sketch at |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| XY | Z = 5 | Z = -3 |
| XZ | Y = 5 | Y = -3 |
| YZ | X = 5 | X = -3 |

---

## Section 2: Bounding Box Interpretation

### 2.1 Reading Bounding Box Data

When `measure(type="body")` returns:
```json
{
  "bounding_box": {
    "min": {"x": -4.25, "y": -8.52, "z": 0.0},
    "max": {"x": 4.25, "y": 8.52, "z": 1.375}
  }
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- Body extends from X = -4.25 to X = +4.25 (centered on origin, width = 8.5)
- Body extends from Y = -8.52 to Y = +8.52 (centered on origin, depth = 17.04)
- Body extends from Z = 0 to Z = 1.375 (sitting on XY plane, height = 1.375)

### 2.2 Surface Location Identification

| To find this surface... | Look at... | The surface is at... |
|-------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Left side | bounding_box.min.x | X = min.x |
| Right side | bounding_box.max.x | X = max.x |
| Back (away from viewer) | bounding_box.min.y | Y = min.y |
| Front (toward viewer) | bounding_box.max.y | Y = max.y |
| Bottom | bounding_box.min.z | Z = min.z |
| Top | bounding_box.max.z | Z = max.z |

### 2.3 Determining "Inside" vs "Outside"

For a HOLLOW body (like a phone case shell):
- **Outside/Exterior**: At the bounding box min/max values
- **Inside/Interior**: Between exterior and (exterior ± wall_thickness)

Example for a case with 0.3cm walls:
```
Exterior right surface: X = +4.25
Interior right surface: X = +4.25 - 0.3 = +3.95
```

## Section 3: Pre-Operation Verification Protocol

### 3.1 Before EVERY Geometry Operation

**STOP and complete this checklist BEFORE calling any geometry tool:**

```
□ Step 1: STATE THE INTENT
  - What am I trying to create?
  - Where should the NEW material exist in space?
  - What are the X, Y, Z coordinates of the new geometry's bounds?

□ Step 2: QUERY EXISTING GEOMETRY
  - Call measure(type="body") or get_body_info()
  - Identify relevant surfaces from bounding box
  - Note wall thickness if operating on shelled body

□ Step 3: PLAN THE OPERATION
  - Which plane will the sketch be on?
  - What offset is needed to place sketch at correct location?
  - Which direction will extrusion go (+ or -)?
  - What distance is needed?
  - ⚠️ APPLY Z-NEGATION RULE if using XZ or YZ plane!

□ Step 4: PREDICT THE RESULT
  - Calculate expected new bounding box min/max
  - Verify new geometry will be WHERE INTENDED
  - Verify new geometry will INTERSECT target body (if joining/cutting)

□ Step 5: EXECUTE AND VERIFY
  - Run the operation
  - Call measure() to verify actual vs predicted bounds
  - Request visual verification if uncertain
```

### 3.2 Sketch Coordinate Calculation Checklist

**For XY Plane:**
```
□ Sketch x1, x2 = World X values (direct)
□ Sketch y1, y2 = World Y values (direct)
□ Offset = World Z position of sketch
```

**For XZ Plane:**
```
□ Sketch x1, x2 = World X values (direct)
□ Sketch y1, y2 = NEGATE World Z values and SWAP order
  → Want Z from A to B? Use y1=-B, y2=-A
□ Offset = World Y position of sketch
```

**For YZ Plane:**
```
□ Sketch x1, x2 = NEGATE World Z values and SWAP order
  → Want Z from A to B? Use x1=-B, x2=-A
□ Sketch y1, y2 = World Y values (direct)
□ Offset = World X position of sketch
```

### 3.3 Extrusion Direction Verification

**Before extrude():**

1. Note the sketch plane (determines extrusion axis)
2. Determine if material should go in + or - direction
3. Calculate endpoint: `sketch_offset + (sign × distance)`
4. Verify: "Extruding [DISTANCE] will create material from [START] to [END] on [AXIS]"

| Plane | Extrude + | Extrude - |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| XY | +Z (up) | -Z (down) |
| XZ | +Y (toward viewer) | -Y (away from viewer) |
| YZ | +X (right) | -X (left) |

## Section 4: Empirically Verified Error Case Library

The cases below were discovered through actual CAD failures during development. Each documents the failure scenario, root cause, correct pattern, and verification source where available. These findings are implementation-agnostic — they apply to any system that interfaces with Fusion 360's coordinate system and geometry kernel.

### 4.1 Error Case 001: Grip Ridges in Empty Space

**Date**: 2024-12-09
**Operation**: Add grip ridges to side of phone case

**What I Did**:
- Sketch plane: YZ at offset X = 4.25 (right side of case)
- Sketch geometry: Three rectangles for ridges
- Extrusion: distance = 0.15 (positive, meaning +X direction)

**What I Expected**:
- Ridges would appear on the right side of the case

**What Actually Happened**:
- Ridges extruded in +X direction, AWAY from the case into empty space
- Ridges are floating 0.15cm to the right of the case, not attached

**Root Cause**:
- Sketch was placed AT the outer surface (X = 4.25)
- Positive extrusion went +X (further right, away from case)
- Ridges were created but not intersecting the case body

**Generalizable Lesson**:
- Before extruding, ask: "Will the extruded material INTERSECT my target body?"
- For features protruding from a surface: sketch ON surface, extrude AWAY from body center
- Verify the extrusion creates geometry that touches/intersects existing bodies

### 4.2 Error Case 002: Z-Axis Negation Discovery

**Date**: 2024-12-09
**Operation**: Add bump to right side (+X face) of calibration block

**What I Did (First Attempt)**:
- Sketch plane: YZ at offset X = 2
- Rectangle: x1=-0.5, x2=0.5, y1=0.5, y2=1.5
- Expected World coords: Y=-0.5 to 0.5, Z=0.5 to 1.5

**What Actually Happened**:
- Got: Y=0.5 to 1.5, Z=-0.5 to 0.5
- The Y and Z were swapped AND Z was in wrong location

**What I Did (Second Attempt)**:
- Hypothesized: Sketch X → World Z, Sketch Y → World Y
- Rectangle: x1=0.5, x2=1.5, y1=-0.5, y2=0.5
- Expected World Z: 0.5 to 1.5

**What Actually Happened**:
- Got World Z: -1.5 to -0.5
- Z was NEGATED!

**What I Did (Third Attempt)**:
- Applied negation: x1=-1.5, x2=-0.5 (to get World Z 0.5 to 1.5)
- SUCCESS!

**Root Cause**:
- YZ plane: Sketch X maps to **negative** World Z
- This is NOT documented in standard references
- Same pattern found on XZ plane (Sketch Y → negative World Z)

**Generalizable Lesson**:
- **Z-NEGATION RULE**: When Z is part of sketch plane, the sketch coordinate mapping to Z is NEGATED
- XZ plane: Sketch Y = -World Z
- YZ plane: Sketch X = -World Z
- To get World Z from A to B, use sketch coord from -B to -A

### 4.3 Error Case 003: XZ Plane Z-Negation Confirmation

**Date**: 2024-12-09
**Operation**: Add bump to back face (-Y) of calibration block

**What I Did (First Attempt)**:
- Sketch plane: XZ at offset Y = -2
- Rectangle: x1=-0.5, x2=0.5, y1=0.5, y2=1.5
- Expected World Z: 0.5 to 1.5

**What Actually Happened**:
- Got World Z: -1.5 to -0.5
- Confirmed: XZ plane also has Z negation!

**What I Did (Corrected)**:
- Applied negation: y1=-1.5, y2=-0.5
- SUCCESS!

**Generalizable Lesson**:
- Z-negation rule applies to BOTH XZ and YZ planes
- Only XY plane has direct mapping (Z is extrusion axis, not in sketch)

### 4.4 Error Case 004: Face Index Instability After Geometry Operations

**Date**: 2024-12-09
**Operation**: Shell a filleted body

**What I Did**:
- Created solid block, extruded on XY plane
- Applied fillet to 4 vertical corner edges
- Queried faces BEFORE fillet: Top face was index 4
- Attempted shell with faces_to_remove=[4]

**What Actually Happened**:
- Shell removed the WRONG face (middle of body)
- Created two disconnected pieces instead of hollow case
- The face that WAS index 4 before filleting was NO LONGER index 4 after filleting

**Root Cause**:
- Fillet operation added 4 new curved faces (one per corner)
- This shifted all face indices
- Original face 4 (top) became face 2 after filleting
- I used stale index data

**What I Should Have Done**:
- Re-query get_body_info() AFTER the fillet operation
- Find the top face by centroid.z = max height, not by remembered index
- Never trust face/edge indices across geometry-modifying operations

**Generalizable Lesson**:
- **INDEX INSTABILITY RULE**: Face and edge indices change after ANY geometry-modifying operation
- After fillet, chamfer, shell, extrude, or any feature: RE-QUERY indices
- Identify faces/edges by GEOMETRY (centroid, area, length) not by index memory
- To find top face: look for face with centroid.z = body max.z
- To find bottom face: look for face with centroid.z = body min.z
- To find side faces: look for faces with centroid at x/y extremes

**Identification Strategy**:
```
To find TOP face after modifications:
1. Call get_body_info()
2. Find face where centroid.z equals bounding_box.max.z
3. Use THAT index for shell/other operations

To find BOTTOM face:
1. Find face where centroid.z equals bounding_box.min.z

To find SIDE faces:
1. Find faces where centroid.x or centroid.y equals bounding box extremes
```

## Section 5: Post-Operation Verification Checklist

### 5.1 After Every Geometry Operation

```
□ Call measure(type="body") on the affected body
□ Compare actual bounding box to predicted bounding box
□ Verify:
  - min.x, max.x match expected X bounds (±0.001 tolerance)
  - min.y, max.y match expected Y bounds (±0.001 tolerance)  
  - min.z, max.z match expected Z bounds (±0.001 tolerance)
□ If multiple bodies exist, verify correct body was modified
□ Check body count - did operation create new body or modify existing?
□ For assemblies: call check_interference()
□ If ANY verification fails: STOP and diagnose before proceeding
```

## Section 6: Quick Reference Cards

### 6.1 "Sketch Coordinate Calculator" Card

```
STEP 1: Identify target World coordinates
  World X: Xa to Xb
  World Y: Ya to Yb
  World Z: Za to Zb

STEP 2: Choose plane based on which surface you're working on
  - Top/Bottom (horizontal) → XY plane
  - Front/Back → XZ plane
  - Left/Right → YZ plane

STEP 3: Calculate sketch coordinates

  XY PLANE (offset = Z position):
    x1=Xa, x2=Xb, y1=Ya, y2=Yb

  XZ PLANE (offset = Y position):
    x1=Xa, x2=Xb, y1=-Zb, y2=-Za  ← Z NEGATED

  YZ PLANE (offset = X position):
    x1=-Zb, x2=-Za, y1=Ya, y2=Yb  ← Z NEGATED
```

### 6.2 "Extrusion Direction" Card

```
XY plane, extrude +D → material goes UP (toward +Z)
XY plane, extrude -D → material goes DOWN (toward -Z)

XZ plane, extrude +D → material goes TOWARD viewer (+Y)
XZ plane, extrude -D → material goes AWAY from viewer (-Y)

YZ plane, extrude +D → material goes RIGHT (+X)
YZ plane, extrude -D → material goes LEFT (-X)
```

### 6.3 "Sanity Check Questions" Card

Before executing, ask yourself:
1. "Did I apply Z-negation if using XZ or YZ plane?"
2. "If I extrude [DISTANCE] in [DIRECTION], where does the material END UP?"
3. "Does that endpoint make sense for what I'm trying to create?"
4. "Will the new geometry TOUCH the existing body?"
